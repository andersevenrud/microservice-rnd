# microservice-rnd

Microservice architecture demonstration with nodejs (typescript) and Kafka

## About

This is a personal research used for learning more about microservice architectures
and structuring.

**This is probably not safe for production usage.**

Provides a basic frontend administration interface and API that interacts with a runner service that
spawns processes to demonstrate usage of event streams, etc, along with some administration applications
to inspect the underlying services.

## Requirements

One of the following configurations:

1. Local [Docker Compose](#docker-compose)
    * `docker-compose`
2. LocalÂ [Kubernetes Cluster](#kubernetes)
    * `minikube`
    * [`tilt`](https://tilt.dev/)

## Installation

### Docker Compose

> Runs on http://localhost:8080 (and `/<admin-service>/`)

First run migrations:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm cli npm run migrate
docker-compose run --rm cli npm run topics
```

Then start up solution:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Kubernetes

> Runs on http://rnd.lvh.me (and `<admin-service>.rnd.lvh.me`)

> HTTPs is available via a self-signed certificate.

Requires the following minikube addons to be set up:

* [`ingress`](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/addons/ingress/)
* [`ingress-dns`](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/addons/ingress-dns/)

```bash
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=rnd
tilt up
```

Open the interface and click the migration buttons in the top navigation bar
in order to make apps being able to connect to certain services.
